// Object Oriented Programming

/* MDN says :
 * Object-oriented programming is about modeling a system as a collection of objects,
 * where each object represents some particular aspect of the system.
 * These objects contain both functions (or methods) and data. An object provides a public interface
 * to other code that wants to use it but maintains its own private, internal state;
 * other parts of the system don't have to care about what is going on inside the object.
 *  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming
 */

/* I say :
 * In JavaScript there are 2 ways to create these kinds of objects that "[...] contain both functions
 * and data [...] and that maintain their own private, internal state".
 * We can create them by using Factory functions or Constructor functions.
